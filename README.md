Challenge: Implement a jump mechanic in Unity where the game object jumps only when it's on the ground and doesn't jump again until it returns to the ground.

👉 Rules:
- Pressing the space key should make the game object jump.
- The game object should only jump if it's currently on the ground.
- Subsequent space key presses should not trigger another jump until the game object returns to the ground.

🖥️ Technology: Unity
